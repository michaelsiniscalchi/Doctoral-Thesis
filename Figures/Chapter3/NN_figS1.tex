\caption[Summary of behavioral performance for mice in imaging experiments]
{Summary of behavioral performance for mice in imaging experiments. (a) Task performance for mice during M2 imaging experiments. Open triangles, individual experiments. Filled triangles, $mean\pm\mathit{SEM}$. $N = 9$ sessions from 5 mice. (b) Same as \emph{a} for ALM imaging experiments. $N = 8$ sessions from 4 mice. (c) Same as \emph{a} for V1 imaging experiments. $N = 4$ sessions from 2 mice.}
