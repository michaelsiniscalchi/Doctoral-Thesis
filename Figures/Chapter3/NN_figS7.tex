{Rule-decoding and neural trajectory separation in matched trial conditions.
(a, c) Same analysis as in Fig. \ref{fig:NN_fig5}d, limited to the subset of trials with matched conditions defined in Fig. \ref{fig:NN_fig5}f--i. (b, d) Same analysis as in Fig. \ref{fig:NN_fig5}e, limited to the subset of trials with matched conditions. (e, f) Same analysis as in Fig. \ref{fig:NN_fig6}b, limited to the subset of trials with matched conditions. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test for significance; the $p$-values are noted in the figure. $N = 9$ sessions from 5 mice.}
