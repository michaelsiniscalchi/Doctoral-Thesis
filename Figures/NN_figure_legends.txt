Behavioral performance of head-fixed mice in an adaptive sensorimotor decision-making task.
(a) Schematic of experiment. Each trial begins with an auditory cue. A response window starts 0.5 s after cue onset, during which the first lick is recorded as the response for that trial. Water reward is delivered contingent on a correct response. ITI, intertrial interval. (b) Schematic of stimulus–response mappings and block design. (c) Behavioral performance surrounding a block switch from action to sound (left) or sound to action (right). Filled circles, hit rate. Open circles, perseverative error rate. Dotted line, other error rate. Mean ± s.e.m. of 33 action to sound switches and 38 sound to action switches. (d) Performance from one example behavioral session. Trial outcomes: correct (filled circles), perseverative (Per.) error (open circles), other error (open triangles), or miss (cross). Vertical line, block switch. (e) Left and right lick rates for upsweep or downsweep sound cues during all correct sound-guided (black), action-left (red) and action-right (blue) trials. For each choice direction, lick rates in action trials were compared with those in sound trials in 0.1 s bins; black bars, significant differences (P < 0.01, paired t-test). Lines, mean; shading, ± s.e.m. n = 9 sessions from 5 mice.

Transitions in ensemble activity occur earlier and are more abrupt following switch to sound-guided trials.
(a) Schematic illustrating ensemble activity dynamics around a block switch. Each curved line represents a single-trial neural trajectory deduced from calcium imaging data. When contingencies switch, neural trajectories move within the representational space. Trial-by-trial location of ensemble activity patterns was determined by calculating a ratio of Mahalanobis distances, dorigin/(dorigin + ddest), where dorigin and ddest are the Mahalanobis distance from neural trajectory in the current trial to those of the 20 trials pre-switch for the last and current blocks, respectively. (b) Two switches from action to sound blocks. Top, trial outcomes: correct (filled circles), perseverative error (P-error, open circles), and other error (O-error, open triangles). Bottom, trial-by-trial location of ensemble activity patterns. Dots, Mahalanobis distance ratios for individual trials. Lines, fit to logistic functions. Up arrows, behavioral transition trials. Down arrows, neural transition trials. (c) Same as b for two switches from sound to action blocks. Vertical axis is inverted for presentation purposes. (d) Parameters extracted by fitting action-to-sound neural transitions with the logistic function. Arrows, median values. (e) Neural transition trials plotted against behavioral transition trials (Online Methods) for action-to-sound switches. Each symbol represents one block switch. Symbol shapes denote different sessions (Supplementary Fig. 6). Large circle, median value. (f) Mean hit and error rates at the behavioral trial corresponding to specific neural transition locations as estimated by the logistic fit for each action-to-sound transition. Circles, mean ± s.e.m. (g–i) Same as d–f for switches from sound to action block; red arrows, median values; black arrows in g shown for comparison with c. Wilcoxon rank-sum test: for midpoint trial, xo, P = 0.007, z = 2.70; for steepness, k, P = 0.03, z = –2.17; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. Difference in range (L) was not significant (median L, sound: 0.36, action: 0.38; P = 0.8, z = 0.28). Rightmost bar of the histogram includes all instances above the range. n = 33 action-to-sound and 35 sound-to-action switches from 9 sessions from 5 mice.

(h,i) Same as b,c for trials in which stimulus was downsweep, choice was right, outcome was reward for the current trial and choice was right for the prior trial.

Comparison between neural activity patterns in M2, ALM, and V1 during flexible sensorimotor behavior.
(a) Multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the fraction of 562 M2 neurons encoding choice signals as a function of time. Regression was performed with a moving window (duration = 0.5 s, step = 0.5 s) to test for significance with α = 0.01 on all sound-guided trials where current and prior outcomes were hits (i.e., R(n) = 1 and R(n – 1) = 1). Black bars, significant fractions (P < 0.01, binomial test). Gray shading, significance level of 0.01. Dotted line in the middle panel, fraction of cells significant for the interaction term C(n) × C(n – 1). n = 9 sessions from 5 mice. (b) Same as a for 518 ALM neurons. n = 8 sessions from 4 mice. (c) Same as a for 227 V1 neurons. n = 4 sessions from 2 mice. (d) Median accuracy of decoding trial type from individual population activity vectors restricted to matched trials, comparing M2, ALM and V1 ensembles. For S:AL, sound and action-left trial types were decoded from trials where stimulus was upsweep, choice was left, outcome was reward for the current trial and choice was left for the prior trial. For S:AR, sound and action-right trial types were decoded from trials where stimulus was downsweep, choice was right, outcome was reward for the current trial and choice was right for the prior trial. Trial type was decoded with high accuracy using ensemble activity from M2 (matched sound: action-left trials: 84 ± 4%, t8 = 8.37; P = 3 × 10−5; matched sound: action-right trials: 81 ± 2%, t8 = 12.73; P = 1 × 10−6; versus chance level of 50%, one-sample t-test). Open triangles, individual experiments. Filled triangles, mean ± s.e.m. Dotted line, chance-level accuracy. (e) Neural transition parameters obtained by fitting action-to-sound (black) and sound-to-action (red) transitions with the logistic function, comparing M2 and ALM ensembles. Wilcoxon rank-sum test, sound vs. action, M2: midpoint trial (xo), P = 0.007, z = 2.70; k, P = 0.03, z = –2.17; height (L), P = 0.8, z = 0.28; ALM: xo, P = 0.11, z = 1.62; k, P = 0.4, z = 0.89; L, P = 0.51, z = –0.65. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; n.s., not significant. Filled circles, medians. Lines end at 25th and 75th percentiles.

Video tracking of whisker and hindpaw positions during the adaptive decision-making task.
(a) Still frame from a video taken using an infrared webcam. One whisker on each side of the face was painted using a phosphorescent paint marker (cat. #222-C-GO, Marvy Uchida). Whiskers were illuminated by two infrared light-emitting diodes (IR-LED). A third IR-LED was programmed to turn on 1 s before auditory cues, so the video could be synchronized to the task events. When the room light was turned off, the reflected infrared light could be visualized by the webcam. (b) Mean position of the left and right whiskers for different trial conditions for subject M12. These traces were averaged across pre-switch, correct trials. For this analysis, each whisker was converted to a binary mask based on pixel intensity. The centroid of the mask was located in each frame, and then a line was fitted between the centroid and a fixed point on the face. The angle between the fitted line and the horizontal axis is reported, with positive deflections being protractions and negative deflections being retractions of the whisker. (c) Same as (b) for another subject, M13. (d) Still frame from a video showing a painted hind paw. The webcam was positioned under the animal, to record footage through the acrylic tube. The synchronization IR-LED is visible. (e) Mean x- and y- positions of the right hindpaw for different trial conditions for subject M12. Hindpaw and whisker data were obtained from two different behavioral sessions.

Approximating the spread of muscimol during inactivation experiments by injecting low-molecular-weight fluorescein.
Fluorescein (disodium salt, MW=412; #S25328, Fisher Scientific) was injected bilaterally into M2, at the same concentration and volume used for muscimol (5 mM, 46 nL per hemisphere). Animal was euthanized at about the time when behavioral testing would have occurred (1 hr after injections) via transcardial perfusion, and the brain was immediately sectioned with a vibratome. Using a wide-field fluorescence microscope, five images were taken for each brain slice and then stitched together to generate the figures. The image series was fitted to wireframes from the Paxinos and Franklin mouse atlas. These results showed a spread of ~1 mm along the anterior-posterior axis. The fluorescein dye was largely restricted to M2 and Cg1.
