% Chapter Abstract
\lettrine[lines=3,slope=4pt,findent=-3pt]{A}{daptive} behavior requires the flexible use of information based on learned contingencies in the environment. In rodents, the medial frontal cortex (MFC) may function importantly in this process---in part, by representing information related to choices, outcomes, and the context in which decisions are made. However, we lack a detailed understanding of how cortical microcircuits process information during context-dependent behavior. One important basic question regards how this labor is divided among different cell types of the neocortex. We used two-photon calcium imaging during a rule-switching task to separately examine the contributions of PV-, SST-, and VIP-expressing inhibitory neurons, as well as pyramidal excitatory neurons, to the representation of information required for flexible sensorimotor behavior. The activity of all four cell types was significantly modulated by choices and their outcomes, as well as the rules dictating which sensorimotor mappings would lead to a reward.
